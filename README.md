Elevator Pitch:
Let’s Get Trivial is a trivia game with a call back to childhood TV gameshows. No Whammies, No Whammies, No Whammies. The goal was to get a laugh and make something silly and fun. Since we always have to work on boring serious things we wanted to build a game that would be enjoyable to work on while also being a challenge.

Concept:
Use an API to call trivia questions and answers. Create a game with a score that used the questions and answers.

Process:
Trivia API, Chuck Norris Jokes API, local storage for score and user initials, jQuery is the JavaScript library we used. The layout is FlexBox and CSS. Kasey is strong in design so we used her talents there to start. Using the GitHub project we delegated JavaScript tasks between Jules and Jeri. Once we had a mostly functioning product we came back together to improve on functionality as a team.
Challenges: HTML encoding of the questions and answers, using Math.random to generate a random array of buttons for the answer selection
Successes: Very impressive graphics and design. Using CSS to align text correctly on the page.

Future Development:
· Individual pages for each category that has images and animations unique to each page
· Using Show and hide functions to introduce more functionality and graphics
· Add an animated spinning wheel at the end of the game to select Chuck Norris Joke or play a song
· Create your own Whammies avatar option at end of game
